        <h2>Write-Up: Analyzing Waste Flow at Santa Clara University</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Santa Clara University Waste Characterization dataset offers a comprehensive view of waste production across different campus buildings, categorized into various waste streams. The dataset consists of seven columns: 'Date' for the recording date, 'Building' for the source location of the waste, 'Stream' for the type of waste, 'Sub stream' for the specific type of waste, 'Volume' for the amount collected, 'Weight' for the mass of the waste, and 'Notes' for detailed descriptions of the waste entries. Through analysis, I have identified key connections among the labels 'Building,' 'Date,' 'Weight,' and 'Stream.' This visualization, titled "Tracing the Trails of Trash," seeks to shed light on the journey of waste from its origin in different buildings to its endpoint in various waste streams. By visualizing this information, we can uncover patterns and trends over time, offering valuable insights into the university's waste management practices.
</p>
         <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>The story I derived from the data focuses on the trend of waste generated by each building over time. By examining the data according to the recorded dates, I observed the types of waste being dumped from each building. Creating the visualization allowed me to distinguish between different waste categories. This helped identify cases where waste was incorrectly categorized, indicating that people were not always mindful of proper waste disposal.

In the visualization, I choose to represent the waste categorization by weight (in pounds). Users can hover over the links between 'Building' and 'Stream' to see the specific waste contributions. Hovering over the building nodes reveals the types of waste each building produced, while hovering over the stream nodes shows which buildings were responsible for that waste type. Additionally, I included an animation that displays waste categorization over time, based on the date the waste entry was recorded. The animation can be paused at any point to view the weight of specific waste categories.

This visualization is useful for identifying issues with improper waste categorization, which is a significant concern today. It underscores the importance of waste segregation and can help in educating people about proper waste management practices.

        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
        <p>When it came to designing the visualization, I chose Sankey diagrams to represent the data. This decision was based on my desire to show the flow between ‘Building’ and ‘Stream’ labels. Using a Sankey diagram allowed me to clearly illustrate which buildings were contributing to which types of waste and to identify any incorrect classifications. My goal was to create a clean and efficient visualization that clearly conveyed the desired information.

Color Palette and Design Choices:

I selected a vibrant color palette to distinguish each waste stream clearly. Each color is chosen to represent a specific waste type, ensuring that users can easily differentiate between them:

Recycling: Green, symbolizing eco-friendly practices.
Compost: Brown, representing organic waste.
Landfill: Gray, indicating general waste.

Contrast and Readability:

The chosen colors have a high contrast against the background and each other, making the links between buildings and waste streams easy to follow. This contrast ensures that the visualization is accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.

Opacity:

I used varying opacity levels to highlight the flow intensity. More opaque flows represent higher volumes of waste, making it visually intuitive to understand the magnitude of waste streams.

Font Choice:

The font used is a regular black font, providing a clear and legible text that contrasts well with the colorful flows. This choice ensures that labels and hover-over tooltips are easily readable without clashing with the diagram’s colors.

Minimizing Overlap:

I minimized the overlap between links to avoid confusion and ambiguity. This careful placement helps maintain the clarity of connections between buildings and streams.


</p>
        
       
        
        <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
        <p>
The design effectively communicates the waste flow story by highlighting the connections between buildings and waste streams. Users can quickly discern which buildings are the largest waste producers and how waste is distributed across different streams. The interactivity adds a layer of engagement, encouraging users to delve deeper into the data. The Sankey diagram's flow-based representation makes it easy to understand the relationships between buildings and waste streams. Users can quickly grasp which buildings generate the most waste and how that waste is distributed.
</p>
 
        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>For creating the data visualization, I utilized the Flourish online tool. I selected Flourish due to its extensive range of visualization options, from simple bar charts to intricate chord diagrams. I believe the visualization I created effectively conveys my intended insights from the dataset. The design rationale includes the appropriate use of contrast and opacity in the colors, along with a suitable font. I used features like date filters and the play/pause button, and the hover feature highlights all the critical information I aimed to present through the visualization.</p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>"Tracing the Trails of Trash" provides a comprehensive and engaging visualization of waste generation and distribution at Santa Clara University. The use of a Sankey diagram effectively highlights the flow of waste from buildings to various streams, making complex data understandable and accessible. The interactive features enhance user engagement, allowing for dynamic exploration of waste patterns over time. This visualization not only serves as an informative tool for understanding waste management practices but also as a foundation for making data-driven decisions to improve sustainability efforts on campus.

By integrating clear design choices, effective use of color and interactivity, and a focus on user engagement, this visualization achieves its goal of providing valuable insights into the waste management practices at Santa Clara University.
